#### Create Route 53 Outbound Endpoint

To begin, we will create a Route 53 **Outbound Endpoint** to enable the Route 53 Resolver to forward DNS queries for domains hosted outside of Route 53. When you create a Route 53 **Outbound Endpoint**, AWS will generate an **elastic network interface** (ENI) in each specified **Availability Zone** (AZ).

1. Access the Route 53 console by using the search box and navigating to Route 53.
   - Expand the left sidebar, choose **Outbound Endpoints**, and then select **Create Outbound Endpoint**.

2. On the **Create Outbound Endpoint** page, provide the following details:
   - **Endpoint name**: R53-OutboundEndpoint
   - **VPC in the Region**: HybridDNS-VPCStack-. (This refers to the VPC created by CloudFormation in the preceding section)
   - **Security group for this endpoint**: d-###â€¦.#_controllers. (This is the security group generated by CloudFormation to secure connections to **AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory**)

3. Configure **IP addresses**:

- For **IP address #1**:
  - Choose **Availability Zone**: "ap-southeast-1a"
  - Select **Subnet**: "Private subnet 1A"
  - Choose **IP address**: "Use an IP address that is selected automatically"
- For **IP address #2**:
  - Choose **Availability Zone**: "ap-southeast-1c"
  - Select **Subnet**: "Private subnet 2A"
  - Choose **IP address**: "Use an IP address that is selected automatically"

5. After approximately 5 minutes, the **Outbound Endpoint** will be configured within your VPC.

6. Once the **Outbound Endpoints** are successfully created, click on an **Outbound Endpoint** to access its details. You will find the IP addresses assigned to the **Outbound Endpoints**. AWS deploys an **elastic network interface** (ENI) into your subnet and assigns the specified IP address to this ENI.
