The first step to building a Windows infrastructure in AWS is to build out the network infrastructure. In this section, you will leverage an AWS Quick Start to build out a secure highly available network infrastructure show below.

AWS Quick Starts leverage AWS CloudFormation which is AWSâ€™s Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows you to create infrastructure based upon a template (written in YAML or JSON). The template is uploaded to the CloudFormation service and itc creates the infrastructure described in the template.
